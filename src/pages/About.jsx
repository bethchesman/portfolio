        <p>
          I’m a software developer with a passion for building scalable, performant, and impactful programs. I specialize in Python and SQL, 
          and I’m constantly learning new technologies to solve complex problems. 
          Currently, I'm enhancing my frontend and design skills by making and upgrading this webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated from UBC in April of 2024 and am currently open to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy solving puzzles, running, and reading.
